### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I have never created a spell 
    checker that read a different file and scanned it for misspelled words. I thought 
    that it was going to be very difficult to code, but it was surprisingly easy to do, 
    so I was very happy that I was able to code it with little issue. Within this part, 
    I learned how to write functions that would open and read a file, compare such file 
    to a "dictionary" file, and print out the misspelled words contained within the 
    opened file.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3 was another favorite lab of mine because I was curious as to how 
    images were displayed on devices (how the code would look). The image created in 
    lab 10, part 3 was also a color gradient, making it more visually appealing but 
    also making it seem difficult to code. However, writing the code wasn't actually 
    too difficult and was relatively easy and fun to write. Using the Magick library 
    for the first time, I was able to learn and write functions to create an image that 
    had a color gradient.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 2 was my favorite lab because we created an animated image with custom 
    writing. Once again, I thought it would be difficult to code, but it wasn't. I 
    thought it was really cool and interesting to create such an image, especially 
    since we had only created a predictable, animated gif before hand. Using the 
    Magick library, I was able to write functions that created an image that not only 
    had color, but was also animated/changing colors randomly. This image also had text 
    located in the middle of it that I could change whenever I wanted.
