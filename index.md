### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I have never created a spell 
    checker that read a different file and scanned it for misspelled words. I thought 
    that it was going to be very difficult to code, but it was surprisingly easy to do, 
    so I was very happy that I was able to code it with little issue. Within this part, 
    I learned how to write functions that would open and read a file, compare such file 
    to a "dictionary" file, and print out the misspelled words contained within the 
    opened file.
