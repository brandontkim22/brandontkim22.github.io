# Brandon Kim's Personal Portfolio Website

Hi and welcome to my personal portfolio website! Please feel free to explore both my repo and my website!

## How to run my project locally (from scratch)

If you want to run my project locally, here is how to do so:
1. Download all files from the repo and save them into a new directory.
2. If you haven't already, please download VSCode and install the "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey.
3. Open the recently created directory with VSCode and open the index.html file.
4. Right click on the viewing port of the file and select the "Open with Live Server" option.
5. You should now be able to see my website running on localhost.
